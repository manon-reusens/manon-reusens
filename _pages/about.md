Hi, I am Manon Reusens, a PhD student at the KU Leuven supervised by Professor Bart Baesens at the KU Leuven and co-supervised by Professor Seppe vanden Broucke at the UGent and KU Leuven and Professor Wouter Verbeke at KU Leuven. \\ I am part of the Research Centre for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS) at the Faculty of Business and Economics at the KU Leuven. Throughout my PhD I have focused on many different applications of Natural Language Processing. Currently, I am mostly focused on NLP ethics, and Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics. 

üéµ I am also very passionate about music.  ùÑ¢ I have been playing the cello for more than 20 years, üé§ love to sing  in different bands, üéπ and also play the piano .
